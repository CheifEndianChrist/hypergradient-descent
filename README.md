# hypergradient-descent
This is the [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) code for the paper: [_Online Learning Rate Adaptation with Hypergradient Descent_](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkrsAzWAb)

A [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) version is also planned and should appear in this repo at a later time.

## How to run
Coming soon.
